This is a project that my project partners and I collaborated on in the CS61BL class during the summer.
This project employs the usage of different data structures that we learned in the class.
Gitlet is a miniature version of Git, a version control system that's easy to use. 
Our implementation of the project uses the Serializable interface and created data structures of commits and functions.
We used a SHA-1 coding scheme to identify and serialize and potentially deserialize the commit. 


DISCLAIMER:
OUR GROUP WAS PERFORMING THE FUNCTIONS AS DESIRED BUT WAS GETTING ODD ERRORS AND DIFFERING GRADES WHEN WE TESTED IT ON 
THE AUTOGRADER. AFTER TRYING TO DEBUG, THE CLASS'S HEAD INSTRUCTOR GAVE US AN OVERRIDE FILE TO TURN IN SPECIFICALLY FOR US
